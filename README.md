# code_Challenge_Kernel_Methods_SKUK_ASSERPE
Our code for the challenge, as a python file.

The data files are expected to be in the folder 'data' which is at the same level as 'code.py'.

There is also a python notebook containing some tests and outputs. In case you want to re-execute it, you can do it in colab or Jupyter but you have to set the variable 'in_colab' defined in the begining in consequence.

You can make a prediction calling from a command line 'python code.py' : this will generate a file 'Yte.csv' in the same directory.
